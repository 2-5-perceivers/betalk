# betalk
A very simple yet very shitty chat app

front end -> flutter (dart)

back end -> python 3, kotlin

This is made for learning, so no hate

Also this README will be updated later

target platforms:

* linux - done
* windows - done
* android - done
* ios - done
* web (not working on right now)

In the near future we will add betalk to snap, aur and maybe to flatpak

That's all.
